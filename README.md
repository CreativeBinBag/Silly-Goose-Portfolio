[Silly Goose Portfolio](https://creativebinbag.github.io/Silly-Goose-Portfolio/)

A humble attempt to create a portfolio in the form of an RPG. My goal was to capture the essence of classic GBA games. Initially, I planned to use Kaboom.JS, but I decided it would be a valuable exercise to build my own game engine from scratch using JavaScript, supplemented by HTML5 Canvas. I created the sprite sheets and the map using Piskel and Adobe Illustrator. All the elements in the map resemble everything that can be found in my room in real life. The game features one player-a spitting image of yours truly-and an NPC called Silly Goose. The highlights of this project include character controls, animations, cutscenes, and collision detection.. I used the 8-bit remix of 'King of Carrot Flowers' by Neutral Milk Hotel as the background music (one of my favorites). Currently, the game can only be played properly on a computer. In the future, I aim to make it compatible with other devices.

Here's how to play:
1) Walk up to the goose (use the arrow keys to move the player).
2) Position the player so it is facing the goose.
3) Press Enter.

If this sounds a bit confusing, I recommend watching the attached video to see how it all works.
