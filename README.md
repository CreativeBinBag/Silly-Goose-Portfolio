[Silly Goose Portfolio](https://creativebinbag.github.io/Silly-Goose-Portfolio/)

A humble attempt to create a portfolio in the form of an RPG. My goal was to capture the essence of classic GBA games. Initially, I planned to use Kaboom.JS, but I decided it would be a valuable exercise to build my own game engine from scratch using JavaScript. Currently, the game can only be played properly on a computer. In the future, I aim to make it compatible with other devices.

Here's how to play:
1) Walk up to the goose (use the arrow keys to move the player).
2) Position the player so it is facing the goose.
3) Press Enter.

If this sounds a bit confusing, I recommend watching the attached video to see how it all works.
